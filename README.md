# KA Supermarket Game
## Summary
The Supermarket Game is an engaging game where players manage a virtual supermarket, handle inventory, and serve customers to earn coins and experience points. Complete levels to unlock new items, earn rewards, and gain rebirths. This game includes leaderboard functionality for global challenges once all levels are completed. 

## How to play the game
1. Serve Customers: Customers appear in random slots with requests for items. Click on a customer slot to see the requested item and serve them by having the item in inventory.
2. Manage Inventory: Visit the shop to buy items and manage stock. Each item costs a specific amount of coins.
3. Level Up: Gain experience points by serving customers. When you accumulate enough XP, you level up, unlocking new items and earning coins.
4. Rebirths: Upon completing all 20 levels, you’ll gain a rebirth, resetting levels but with increased rewards and new global challenges.
   * Win Condition: Continue leveling up, unlocking items, and gaining rebirths to challenge global leaderboards.
   * Loss Condition: Running out of coins and inventory might delay progress, but the game doesn’t have a hard loss state.
